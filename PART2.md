## <u>**Problems Encountered & Solutions**</u>

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

1. Unable to retrieve the created vector data for Zombie hp, atk, range / alien hp. <br/>
><b>Solution:</b> Use pass by reference method.
2. The vectors were glitching out when doing save/load function call.
><b>Solution:</b> Found out it was due to vector size not being transferred properly when saving and loading, and fixed it.
3. The Zombies were constantly crashing into one another and consuming each other
><b>Solution:</b> Added a bool value for if the Zombies are crashing into one another, and made a function to make sure overlapping doesn't happen.
4. Alien and Zombies were going out of bounds and causing ***Segfaults*** (kill me)
><b>Solution:</b> Added bool for hitBarrier to stop Alien/Zombie from moving any further.
5. Zombie numbers were going haywire after it moves.
><b>Solution:</b> Added in a vector inside the Enemy class in order to keep track of it anywhere.
6. Alien kept on stopping after one input.
><b>Solution:</b> We just put in an internal loop, as in a function inside of itself.
7. Players could go into the save file and edit it to gain unfair advantage.
><b>Solution:</b> Encrypted it, albeit not that secure, but will be better than just leaving it as it is.
